# StressDetection-NeuralNet
This repository contains the software of two deep neural networks performing the tasks of binary class detection and 3-class emotion classification described in the paper:
      “Stress Detection Using Deep Neural Networks” by Russell Li and Zhandong Liu.

The neural networks were implemented in Keras (version 2.3.1) with Tensorfow as its backend.
